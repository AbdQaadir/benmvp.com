- most of the time you pass a primitive or prop as default value to `useState()`
- but if you need to make a function call to generate default data
  - you may not want to make that function call every re-render because it's not gonna be used
  - usually it won't affect performance unless you're doing some intense calc or I/O
- can pass a function to return the default data
  - function only gets called once
  - basically adding `() =>` creates the optimization

Keep learning my friends. ğŸ¤“
