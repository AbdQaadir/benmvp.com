- React is Just JavaScript (TM)
  - Gatekeepers like to say you need to be great at JS before you can do JS
  - I used to feel the same way
  - Not to keep folks out, but I knew how much easier React would be
  - Now I tell people to learn how they learn
  - But eventually you'll need to understand modern JS
  - Here are some common features
- Arrow functions
  - `.map` example w/ `function`, implicit return, full
  - component
  - event callback
  - render prop
- Template strings
- Array destructuring
  - For `useState`
  - rest operator
- Object destructuring
  - For props
  - Can use in arrow function
  - rest operator
- Spread operator
  - Arrays & objects
- Promises & Fetch API
- `async`/`await`
- `import`/`export`
  - Do `export` first to show how to import

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
