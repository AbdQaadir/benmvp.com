- "Rules":
  - No using lodash (the whole point)
  - Skipping the obvious new ES functionality (like `.find()`)
  - No mutations
  - Single top-level statement (chaining and/or inner functions are fine)
- Transforms
  - delete item(s) from array
  - replace item in array
  - empty array of X items
  - array -> object lookup
  - object map keys
  - object map values
  - zip arrays
  - array difference
  - array intersection
  - array union
  - unique array
  - object omit
  - object pick

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
