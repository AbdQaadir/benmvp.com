- Ultimately gonna render an array of elements
  - Must use `key` prop
- Question is how to transform an array of data to an array of elements
- Most common is with a `.map()`
  - Can be combined with `.filter()` and other array methods
- Another option is using a `for`-loop (`for-of` as well)

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
